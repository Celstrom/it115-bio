A repo to store info for a short bio

Hello, my name is Colton Elstrom. I am currently a student in the YearUp program studying Application Development, but my passion outside of school and work is music. I have been playing guitar for over ten years and have structured my life around it. I also have a love for the great outdoors, camping has been a family tradition of ours since I was just a baby. In the past I was a Scale technician where I would go around and calibrate and fix scales for weighing various things and I did this for five years before deciding that I wanted to get into the tech industry.
