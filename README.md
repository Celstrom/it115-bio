A repo to store info for a short bio

Hello, my name is Colton Elstrom. I am currently a student in the YearUp program studying Application Development where I am honing my skills to become an emerging professional in the tech field. My passion outside of school and work is music. I have been playing guitar for over ten years and have structured my life around it. I also have a love for camping, fishing, and really just anything in nature. In the past, I was a Scale technician where I would certify and repair broken scales which taught me how to be a critical thinker and work well with customers and groups. I did this for five years before deciding that I wanted to get into the tech industry and begin a new career path.
