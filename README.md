A repo to store info for a short bio

Hello, my name is Colton Elstrom and I am a full time student at Year Up where Iâ€™m studying Application Development. I am learning HTML, Javascript and website construction while gaining skills in excel and proper etiquette in a business environment. In my previous job as a scale technician, I worked with various companies, gaining customer service experience and learning how to write code for batching systems. My goal is to become a Software Developer at a tech company in the Seattle area.
